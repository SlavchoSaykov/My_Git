Step 1. Install Prerequisites
In order to use ESP-IDF with the ESP32, you need to install some software packages based on your Operating System. This setup guide will help you on getting everything installed on Linux and macOS based systems.

For Linux Users
To compile using ESP-IDF you will need to get the following packages. The command to run depends on which distribution of Linux you are using:

Ubuntu and Debian:
sudo apt-get install git wget flex bison gperf python3 python3-venv cmake ninja-build ccache libffi-dev libssl-dev dfu-util libusb-1.0-0

CentOS 7 & 8:
sudo yum -y update && sudo yum install git wget flex bison gperf python3 cmake ninja-build ccache dfu-util libusbx


Installing Python 3
Based on macOS Catalina 10.15 release notes, use of Python 2.7 is not recommended and Python 2.7 will not be included by default in future versions of macOS. Check what Python you currently have:

python --version

If the output is like Python 2.7.17, your default interpreter is Python 2.7. If so, also check if Python 3 isn’t already installed on your computer:

python3 --version

If the above command returns an error, it means Python 3 is not installed.

Below is an overview of the steps to install Python 3.

Installing with HomeBrew can be done as follows:

brew install python3

If you have MacPorts, you can run:

sudo port install python38

Step 2. Get ESP-IDF
To build applications for the ESP32, you need the software libraries provided by Espressif in ESP-IDF repository.

To get ESP-IDF, navigate to your installation directory and clone the repository with git clone, following 
instructions below specific to your operating system.

Open Terminal, and run the following commands:

mkdir -p ~/esp
cd ~/esp
git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git

ESP-IDF will be downloaded into ~/esp/esp-idf.

Consult ESP-IDF Versions for information about which ESP-IDF version to use in a given situation.

Step 3. Set up the tools
Aside from the ESP-IDF, you also need to install the tools used by ESP-IDF, such as the compiler, debugger, 
Python packages, etc, for projects supporting ESP32.

cd ~/esp/esp-idf
./install.sh esp32

or with Fish shell

cd ~/esp/esp-idf
./install.fish esp32

The above commands install tools for ESP32 only. If you intend to develop projects for more chip targets then 
you should list all of them and run for example:

cd ~/esp/esp-idf
./install.sh esp32,esp32s2

or with Fish shell

cd ~/esp/esp-idf
./install.fish esp32,esp32s2
In order to install tools for all supported targets please run the following command:

cd ~/esp/esp-idf
./install.sh all

or with Fish shell

cd ~/esp/esp-idf
./install.fish all
